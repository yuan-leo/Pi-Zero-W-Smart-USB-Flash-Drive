# Pi Zero W Smart USB Flash Drive

SMB enabled network share that appears as a USB drive to a connected device, and web-based portal for controlling AnyCubic Mono X/SE printers. 

**Security update:** The maintained source now requires portal authentication,
CSRF-checked administrative requests, and a one-time migration of existing images.
Read [Security and deployment](SECURITY_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md) before installing or
upgrading. The legacy image instructions below describe older releases.

## Support

This project is free to use, and I hope you do, but it also take a lot of time to keep working on making it better. Consider "buying me a book" through this [link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tds2021) to help keep this development going.  That way I can learning new ways to make this (and other projects) better.  Think of it as karma-ware.  Have a great day!

## Acknowledgements

I based this project on the work documented in the MagPi magazine [article](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/pi-zero-w-smart-usb-flash-drive) by the same name.  It was written by [Russell Barnes](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/author/77pb3df8MQLs3i8qTd0C8Q). It also borrows some ideas from [Giles Davison's](https://github.com/gilesdavison) now defunct RadaDASH project.

    * Extend the USB storage based on avaialbe space
    * Enable Mono X/SE features
  * RPi power management (reboot / shutdown)
  * RPi eject / reset virtual USP drive

### Installation

Because of the file system changes, you need to re-image your SD card.  The changes are too complex to apply over previous versions. Follow the instruction on the Read Me page.

## 3D Printer Support

This project should work for most (if not all) 3D printers as a USB drive.

However, there is an additional feature for the [ANYCUBIC Photon Mono X](https://www.anycubic.com/products/photon-mono-x-resin-printer) and [ANYCUBIC Photon Mono SE](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/anycubic-photon-3d-printers/products/photon-mono-se-lcd-3d-printer) printers. There is an optional service that can be enabled to dynamically create a `WIFI.txt` file in the ANYCUBIC format to help configure the printer to match the network configuration on the Raspberry Pi W. You can also start / stop / pause print jobs from the portal.It provides simular features as teh AnyCubic Mobile App.

I don't have other printers to test, so I don't know how they are configured.  If they are similar, I'm happy to work with you add support in a future release. Open an issue and make a suggestion. THey must be WiFI enabled and controled from a web API.

### Usage

1. Create SD Card from the provided image file
2. Connect Raspberry Pi Zero W using the **USB port** on the Pi
3. Manage files on the Raspberry Pi from a network share (SMB://)
4. Access the files from the USB interface (after 30 sec)

*Note: Do not add/remove files while you are printing/watching a file from the USB drive.  When you make changes to the stored files, the USB will appear to unplug and reconnect.  This will disrupt any current files being used.*


## Setup Instructions

### Create SD Card

Step 1. Download the latest [release](../../releases).

Step 2. Extract the image from the zip archive.

Step 3. Copy Image to SD Card

(MacOS) Connect the MicroSD card to your computer and flash the usb_share image using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
(Windows) Connect the MicroSD card to your computer and flash the usb_share image using [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/).

Step 4. Edit the [wpa_supplicant.conf](../main/wpa_supplicant.conf) file provided, changing the placeholders network and password to your wireless networks SSID and password. Make sure that an "extra" file extension is added when you savethe file to your computer (such as txt). The file name must remain wpa_supplicant.conf. 

Step 5. Copy the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file to the boot partition of the SD card.

### Powering the Raspberry Pi

On the Pi Zero W, you'll see two micro USB ports. One is marked 'USB' and the other 'PWR IN.' You can supply power through either port, but the USB port is for data as well. There are two options.

#### 1. Printer Power

You can connect your 3D printer into the Pi Zero W USB port, not the PWR IN port, using a standard micro USB cable. The cable will both supply power from the printer and make the USB data connection. The disadvantage is that the printer must be switched on to supply power to the Pi. When someone turns the printer off, the Pi will also lose power, which will also make it no longer available on the network.

#### 2. External power

Alternatively, you can connect a separate, always-on power supply to the PWR IN port and use a slightly modified micro USB cable to connect the printer to the USB port. The modification is to cut the red wire inside the micro USB cable. This protects the Pi from damage that could be caused by drawing power from two different power sources. The advantage of this method is that the Pi is powered independently from the printer. It will be available on the network even if the printer is off, and there is a reduced risk of sudden power loss and SD card corruption.

You might want to test the system with the first option and then move onto the second when you want a more permanent setup. **Don't forget to cut the red wire if you use the second option.**

Connect the Pi Zero W USB port to the printer using your chosen method, power everything up.

### Special note for Mono X 6K

The Mono X 6K printer has a USB Maximum current draw of 0.5A.  Exceeding this will cause the USB port to be unrecognized until the unit is turned off and then back on.  [This issue](https://github.com/tds2021/Pi-Zero-W-Smart-USB-Flash-Drive/issues/48) appears as though the Raspberry Pi does not work as a flash drive. An external power supply (Option 2) must be used for the Raspberry Pi.  



### Connection to the Management Portal (New)

Default URL: http://3dprinter.local or http://[IP ADDRESS]

Port: 80

After the Raspberry Pi has fully booted, you can now access the management protal from any local network web browser. This all featurs of the USB Sahre devices can be managed from this portal other than re-sizing the size fo teh USB drive partition; that must still be done from  command line.



### Connecting to the Network Share

Default Host Name: `3dprinter`

Now we can try to access the share from a Windows PC or a Mac. You'll need the hostname the Raspberry Pi is using or its IP Address. By default, the hostname will be `3DPRINTER`.

In Windows, you can bring up Explorer (Windows key + E) and type `\\3dprinter` (or `\\[IP ADDRESS]`) into the address bar at the top. The Run dialogue also works (Windows key + R).

On macOS, the Raspberry Pi will show up in the Finder sidebar. Alternatively, from the Finder menu, select Go Connect to server (Apple key + K) and type `smb://3dprinter` (or `smb://[IP ADDRESS]`) as the server address.

Once connected, you will see a shared named `USB` where you can load your files. For your update to appear on the printer, it must first disconnect from the printer and then reconnect. Whenever you copy files over to the network-share, or delete them, the USB device should automatically reconnect to the printer after 30 seconds of inactivity.

**Note: After you add files to the drive, you need to wait 30 seconds. After that, the Pi will disconenct and re-connect the USB interface so your changes can appear**
